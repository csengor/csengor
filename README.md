:wave: Hello!

I'm Çağatay, a linguist/dev! I localize software and other wonderful content for a living, and I also like to code. Currently,
I'm working on [Kaplan Desktop](https://github.com/kaplanPRO/kaplan-desktop), a free and open-source computer-assisted translation tool for linguists and LSPs.
I am learning NLP and plan on pursuing it further. Please feel free to contact me at contact@csengor.com.

Take care!
